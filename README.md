## (MacOS) Setting Up Boost, Asio and Beast in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for C++ Development

### Overview

Below will help guiding you setting up Boost, and the sublibrary of Boost in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for C++ development. Boost.Asio and Boost.Beast are necessary network library for this project.

The guideline is mostly for MacOS, but contain some clues may be helpful if you are using Windows.

### Prerequisites

* Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
* C/C++ extension ( in VSCode )
* [Boost Library](https://www.boost.org/) ( one of the library of C++ )
* If you are using **<u>MacOS</u>**â€‹<u> </u>and you find trouble using the link above, try use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install [Boost ( packaged by Homebrew )](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/boost#default).

### Steps

1. **Locate Boost Installation Path**

    * Locate the Boost installation path on your system.
    * The path varies depending on different operating system and different installation methods, so you should search for what suits your situation.
    * Note down the path to the Boost include directory.
2. **Situation 1: Update c_cpp_properties.json ( !!! If you are using MacOS and not Intel, this configuration file will not work; See Situation 2)**

    * Open your project in VSCode.
    * Navigate to the `.vscode` directory within your project.
    * Open the `c_cpp_properties.json` file.
    * Add the Boost include directory path to the `includePath` array:

      ```json
      // This is only for example, do not copy directly!!! 
      // Modify according to you situation
      {
          "configurations": [
              {
                  "name": "Mac",
                  "includePath": [
                      "${workspaceFolder}/**",
                      "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/boost/1.84.0_1/include" // Change this line with your Boost include path
                  ],
                  "defines": [],
                  "macFrameworkPath": [
                      "/System/Library/Frameworks",
                      "/Library/Frameworks"
                  ],
                  "compilerPath": "/usr/bin/clang",
                  "cStandard": "c17",
                  "cppStandard": "c++17",
                  "intelliSenseMode": "clang-x64"
              }
          ],
          "version": 4
      }
      ```
3. **Situation 2: Update tasks.json ( !! If you are MacOS with M1 chips, please try as following )**

    * If you're using `tasks.json` to specify compiler flags, you may need to add the `-I` flag to include the Boost asio library path.
    * Open your `tasks.json` file.
    * Add the Boost asio library path to the compiler arguments:

      ```json
      // This is only for example, do not copy directly!!! 
      // Modify according to you situation
      {
          "tasks": [
              {
                  "type": "cppbuild",
                  "label": "C/C++: clang++ build active file",
                  "command": "/usr/bin/clang++",
                  "args": [
                      "-fcolor-diagnostics",
                      "-fansi-escape-codes",
                      "-g",
                      "${file}",
                      "-o",
                      "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}",
                      "-I",
                      "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/boost/1.84.0_1/include" // Change this line with your Boost asio library path
                  ],
                  "options": {
                      "cwd": "${fileDirname}"
                  },
                  "problemMatcher": [
                      "$gcc"
                  ],
                  "group": {
                      "kind": "build",
                      "isDefault": true
                  },
                  "detail": "Task generated by Debugger."
              }
          ],
          "version": "2.0.0"
      }
      ```
